## What is YogaRight?

**YogaRight** is an innovative application designed to enhance the practice of yoga through the integration of computer vision and machine learning. The app detects yoga poses in real-time and provides instant feedback, helping users correct their form and improve their practice.

## Core features

### 1. **Yoga Pose Detection**
   - **Real-Time Pose Recognition**: The app uses computer vision techniques to analyze the user's body posture in real time, identifying the yoga pose being performed. 
   - **Pose Matching**: The detected pose is matched against a predefined set of yoga poses to ensure accuracy.

### 2. **Live Feedback and Correction**
   - **Pose Correction**: If the detected pose deviates from the ideal form, the app provides immediate feedback, highlighting areas of improvement. This is achieved through an AR overlay that guides the user in adjusting their posture.
   - **Personalized Suggestions**: Based on the user's performance and history, the app offers tailored suggestions to help users gradually improve their flexibility, strength, and overall yoga practice.

## Technical Details

### 1. **Pose Detection**
   - **MediaPipe**: The application leverages advanced libraries like MediaPipe for detecting and tracking the user's body joints in real-time.
   - **Keypoint Extraction**: The app extracts key points of the body (e.g., elbows, knees, shoulders) and compares them with ideal pose key points stored in the system.
   - **Pose Classification**: A machine learning model classifies the detected pose into one of the predefined yoga poses, allowing for accurate feedback.

### 2. **Feedback Mechanism**
   - **Deviation Analysis**: The app calculates the deviation between the user's current pose and the ideal pose, identifying specific areas where the user needs to adjust.
   - **AR Integration**: Augmented Reality (AR) technology is used to overlay corrections and suggestions directly onto the user's live camera feed, making the feedback intuitive and easy to follow.
   - **Voice and Text Feedback**: The app also provides verbal and written feedback, ensuring that the user understands what needs to be corrected.

### 3. **User Personalization**
   - **Progress Tracking**: The app tracks the user's progress over time, adjusting the difficulty of feedback and suggestions based on their improvement.
   - **Custom Workouts**: Users can create custom yoga sessions based on their goals, with the app providing feedback tailored to their specific needs.

## Future Enhancements

- **Pose Difficulty Levels**: Introduce graded difficulty levels for each pose, allowing users to progress from beginner to advanced levels.
- **Integration with Wearables**: Enhance pose detection and correction accuracy by integrating data from wearable devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers.
- **Community Features**: Add social features that allow users to share their progress, challenges, and achievements with others in the YogaRight community.
